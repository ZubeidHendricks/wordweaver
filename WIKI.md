- Psychological Profile Management

#### Memory Model
```javascript
cognitivModel = {
  memoryStrength: {
    shortTerm: {},  // Recent word interactions
    longTerm: {}    // Persistent learning patterns
  },
  learningCurves: {
    letterRecognition: {},     // Letter complexity tracking
    wordPatternRecognition: {} // Word pattern learning
  }
}
```
